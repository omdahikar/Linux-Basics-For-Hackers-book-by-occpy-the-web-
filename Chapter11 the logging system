we’ll look at the daemon that does the logging.
 Linux uses a daemon called syslogd to automatically log events on your com
 puter. Several variations of syslog, including rsyslog and syslog-ng, are used 
on different distributions of Linux
Debian comes with rsyslog by default
locate rsyslog --> search for all files related to rsyslog
leafpad /etc/rsyslog.conf
 below line 55, you’ll find the Rules section. This is where you can set the rules for what your 
Linux system will automatically log for you.
 auth, authpriv Security/authorization messages
 cron Clock daemons
 daemon Other daemons
 kern Kernel messages
 lpr Printing system
 mail Mail system
 user Generic userlevel messages

 (*) in place of a word refers to all facilities
 Here’s the full list of valid codes for priority:

e priority tells the system what kinds of messages to log. Codes are 
listed from lowest priority, starting at debug, to highest priority, ending at 
panic. If the priority is *, messages of all priorities are logged


 •	debug
 •	info
 •	notice
 •	warning
 •	warn
 •	error
 •	err
 •	cri
 •	crit
 •	alert
 •	emerg
 •	panic

 warn, error, and panic should not be used
 logs generated by the auth facility would be sent to 
/var/log.auth.log.

 mail.* /var/log/mail -->  all (*) priorities to /var/log/mail.
 kern.crit /var/log/kerne --> will log kernel events of critical (crit) priority or higher 
to /var/log/kernel.

 *.emerg :omusmsg:*
all the events of the emergency (emerg) priority to all logged-on users

 Automatically Cleaning Up Logs with logrotate
Log rotation is the process of regularly archiving log files by moving them 
to some other location, leaving you with a fresh log file. That archived loca
 tion will then get cleaned up after a specified period of time.

>leafpad /etc/logrotate.conf

At the end of each rotation period, the log files are renamed and pushed 
toward the end of the chain of logs as a new log file is created, replacing the 
current log file. For instance, /var/log.auth will become /var/log.auth.1, then 
/var/log.auth.2, and so on
>ls /var/log/auth.log*
man logrotate.conf --> for more learning 

better and more secure solution is to shred the log files instead of removing file after finding the files by file detection methods ch2
shred --help --> there was a 
way to delete the file and overwrite it several times
by default, shred overwrites four times

-f option, which changes the permissions on the files to allow overwriting if a permission change is neces
 sary, 
–n option, which lets you choose how many times to overwrite the files

shred -f -n 10 /var/log/auth.log.* --> delete + overwrite

Disabling logging  of course, requires root privileges. stop the rsyslog daemon. 
service servicename start|stop|restart --> syntax
>service rsyslog stop
 Linux will stop generating any log files until the service is 
restarted
