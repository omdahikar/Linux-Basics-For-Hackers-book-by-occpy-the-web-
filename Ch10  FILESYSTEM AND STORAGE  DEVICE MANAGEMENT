dev is short for device
ex. cdrom and cpu, but others have 
rather cryptic names
interest are the devices sda1, sda2, sda3, sdb, and 
sdb1, which are usually the hard drive and its partitions and a USB flash 
drive and its partitions.
floppy drives (remember those?) as fd0 
and hard drives as hda
old legacy hard drives that used an IDE or 
E-IDE inte rface are still represented in the form hda
 
Newer Serial ATA (SATA) interface drives and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) hard 
drives are represented as sda.

 view the partitions on your Linux system can be used as  fdisk utility

fdisk indicates that it is an HPFS/NTFS/ExFAT filesystem type

High Performance File System (HPFS), New Technology File System 
(NTFS), and Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT)â€”are not native to 
Linux systems but rather to macOS and Windows systems

Windows use an NTFS filesystem, whereas older Windows 
systems use File Allocation Table (FAT) systems. Linux uses a number of 
different types of filesystems, but the most common are ext2, ext3, and 
ext4. These are all iterations of the ext (or extended) filesystem, with ext4 
being the latest.

List Block Devices and Information with lsblk
 >lsblk

output may include the floppy drive as fd0 and DVD drive as sr0,
>mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
>mount /dev/sdc1 /media 	
umount /dev/sdb1

command df (for disk free) will provide us with basic information on 
any hard disks or mounted devices, such as CD, DVD, and flash drives, 
including how much space is being used and how much is available 
 >df

 Checking for Errors
fsck command (short for filesystem check) checks the filesystem for errors 
and repairs the damage, if possible, or else puts the bad area into a bad blocks 
table to mark it as bad
must unmount the drive before
>umount /dev/sdb1
 -p option to have fsck automatically repair any problems 
with the device
 >fsck -p /dev/sdb1
with the device unmounted, I can now check for any bad sectors or 
other problems with the device,
